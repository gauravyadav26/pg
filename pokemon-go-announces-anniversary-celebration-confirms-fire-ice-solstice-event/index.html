	<div class="entry-content container" id="c-cont">
		<p><em><a href="https://www.pokemongroup.com/category/pokemon-go/" class="ilgen">Pokemon GO</a></em> is kicking things back into high gear. Schools are letting out, colder climes are warming up, and the augmented reality monster-hunting game is waking from a relative slumber to capitalize on its one-year anniversary. Today brought with it a slew of announcements from real-life events to rumors about some actual gameplay additions, so there&#8217;s reason to be excited even if I&#8217;m as cautious as always here.</p>
<p>The first event is the previously-leaked fire and ice-themed &#8220;Solstice Event,&#8221; kicking off June 13. Relative to what it seems like we&#8217;ll be getting soon, the Solstice Event seems like a pretty standard iteration on the events that we&#8217;ve been seeing ever since Halloween: increased spawns on fire and ice Pokemon, discounted Lucky Eggs and, interestingly, &#8220;huge&#8221; XP bonuses for accurate Pokeball throws, which will throw a fun little wrinkle into the experience of actually catching the creatures. That&#8217;s about it for the relatively constrained Solstice Event, however.</p>
<p>After that, we&#8217;ve got the first-ever real world event, <em>Pokemon GO</em> Fest in Downtown Chicago&#8217;s Grant Park. There aren&#8217;t many details about just what the fest will entail, but my guess is that it will be more real life party than in-game event, because the game needs to be very careful about restricting rewards even so far after launch.<br />
<script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />

<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script><br />
Tickets for that go live at 10:00 AM PDT on June 19, so expect those to go very, very fast. The Chicago event will be followed by a series of European events and a &#8220;Pikachu Outbreak&#8221; in Yokohoma, Japan. I&#8217;m honestly a bit more interested in the European events than the Chicago party: big-ticket festivals are fun and all, but the European events may provide a better framework for how these sorts of things will actually become an established part of the regular game.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more news to come, including some sort of update to include &#8220;collaborative&#8221; gameplay into the gym system, which could range from the inclusion of PvP to the sorts of raids that we&#8217;ve been wondering about since well before launch. This summer could be a big moment for <em>Pokemon GO</em>, so keep an eye on what&#8217;s happening.</p>
